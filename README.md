# Biometric_temperature_Attendance
Covid-19 came with some challenges, with universities re-opening it is definitely a challenge to practice social distancing norms.
this project consists of an MLX90614 sensor and a fingerprint sensor.
Its easy... if the body temperature is high: no finger print access is given...

Parts:

mlx90614 breakout board

Adafruit R307 fingerprint sensor

Arduino Uno / raspberry pi

NOTE: Install the two libraries from Library manager

Usage: 

Serial communication options

Type the following in the serial communication window

a - read fingerprint conditional to body temperature

e - enroll a new fingerprint

d - delete a specific fingerprint entry
